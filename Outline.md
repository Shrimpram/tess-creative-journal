## Init
- Scene starts at dairy, Tess is there sleeping
- Intro is Angel coming back from discussion with his parents
- First "choice" player makes is whether or not to get up, just to sort of intro them to the mechs

> O Mr Clare! How you frightened me--I--
Ch XXVII

Or they can refer to him as Angel.

If they pick Mr Clare, he responds with the "Dear, darling Tessy!" quote

Just have some more exposition until Angel pops the question

Then choices:
- Refuse
  - Angel asks why?
    - I have someone else
    - Lie/I don't want to marry (canon)
    - It's you
- Say yes. Say yes takes you immediately to wedding scene


## Letter Scene

Tess now has the option to write a letter or not

You can confess to different stuff
- Like lie about your past
- Confess to worse stuff
- Confess truth

Then choice of what to do with the letter

## Wedding Scene
- You can put off the wedding or have it

Putting it off has angel see the letter
- Reaction depending on what you put
  - Confess worse = worse reaction
  - Confessing truth still has same effect

Don't put it off then you have wedding and angel confesses
- You can again choose to not marry him if you want after he confesses

Then you tell him and that's it
